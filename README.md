A tool for building static sites with gulp.  Inspired by wintersmith.

This module's API is unstable and will change.  You probably shouldn't use this in production yet.

Parses files with or without YAML metadata headers and applies templates.

Metadata

Currently supported values are filename and template.  body is set also. Other values are treated as arbitrary locals and merged with defaults.
